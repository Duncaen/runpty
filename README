RUNPTY(1)                   General Commands Manual                  RUNPTY(1)

NAME
     runpty – execute commands in a new pty

SYNOPSIS
     runpty command [args]

DESCRIPTION
     The runpty utility executes the given command with a new pty
     (pseudo-terminal) as the controlling terminal.

     Executing the command in a new pty mitigates the command from using
     ioctl(2)'s like TIOCSTI and TIOCLINUX which can be used to execute
     commands in the shell of the controlling terminal.

EXIT STATUS
     The runpty utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     ioctl(2), ioctl_tty(2), pty(7)
